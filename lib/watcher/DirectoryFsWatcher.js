/**
 * Defines a directory watcher which is a wrapper around Node.js fs.watch.
 *
 * fs.watch only emit "change" and "rename" events, nothing more.
 * This class intends to make it more user friendly by emitting more understandable events like "create" or "delete".
 *
 * It analyzes only "rename" events, "change" events are not constant between Linux and Windows systems.
 * On both Linux and Windows systems :
 * When a file is added a "rename" event is emitted followed by a "change" event
 * When a file is renamed a "rename" event is emitted twice (one for the removal and one for the addition)
 * When a file is removed a "rename" event is emitted
 *
 * To work through this behaviour, a snapshot of the directory is made each time a "rename" event is fired.
 * Then new resources inside the directory are compared to the snapshot to find out which resource has been
 * added or removed.
 *
 * If a "rename" event is emitted while the directory is being analyzed, directory will be analyzed again making every
 * "rename" event count.
